		history: " <p> Officially, the Lensmen do not exist; all the branches of American government deny their existence and offer none of the judicial support that is lent to other individuals who operate within government sanction. </p> Officially, they have no base of operations, and no official government funding; Lensmen deal and dabble in the economy of the world through a confusing and often convoluted network of brokers and traders - obfuscating and complicating their paper trails; this approach means that Lensmen have some difficulty being financially liquid -  but to Lensmen, the freedom to become the shadows of shadows is a more than equitable trade in the long run. <p>Founded during the American Civil War, the Lensmen was the first time individuals from both sides of the war banded together to end it. While ultimately successful, the Lensmen suffered terrible losses during that time, most notably the assassination of one of their leaders - President Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>Over the centuries, the Lensmen would be highly involved in several operations that would shape the country in several ways. It is believed by a few historians who are convinced of the organisationâ€™s existence that the Lensmen anticipated a second world war, engineered the great depression, and ultimately catapulted the USA into an economic, military, technological world power in less than a decade.</p>",
		doctrine: "<p>Lensmen protocol is easy enough to understand - they seek to maintain the order of the world by their most sacred (and subversive) contribution to world policy; E Pluribus Unum. Through the individual efforts of many, the world remains one. The mark of the earliest Lensmen is obvious - it is on the great seal of the United states of America; The symbol of the Lensmen is the all-seeing-eye; also located on american currency. </p>",
		orgStructure: "<p>No one knows the exact number of Lensmen safe-houses, armories or vehicle depots; what is known is that they have full access to America's greatest weapon - the power of production.</p> <p>The Lensmen are the most well-funded espionage organization in the world, and have a steady and plentiful stream of financial assistance from their backers in the United States. </p> <p>Lensmen themselves operate in individual cells, adapting between solo operation to teams as large as small towns, as is required. Their HQ - the prism - is located several stories below the Mall of America - the perfect front to disguise a massive heat signature, as well as a large power and a data sink.</p> <p>The lensmen have full access to global reach of America's military assets, and while their methods and delivery systems are hardly subtle - their solitary nature as well as their predisposition to conspiracy, allow them efficient yet direct insertions to wherever they need to be.</p>"
